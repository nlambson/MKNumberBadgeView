MKNumberBadgeView
=================

Use this class to display a badge containing an integer value. Similar to the app icon badges that the iPhone OS permits.

Original Repo located here: https://github.com/monospacecollective/MKNumberBadgeView.git

This repo is meant to be used with iOS 7, if it is backwards compatible that is only by chance.
